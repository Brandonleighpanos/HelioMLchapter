# Analyzing the behavior of a single spectral line using unsupervised learning

*by B. Panos*  

In this chapter we will explore how the spectral line associated with once ionized Magnesium (Mg II) behaves during a solar flare. To do this, we will make use of one of the most celebrated classical machine learning algorithms known as the k-means algorithm, to conjointly analyze slit-jaw images (SJI) and spectra collected by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS).

This chapter draws heavily on the functionality provided by IRISreader, a library constructed for the purposes of supporting machine learning exploration on data collected by IRIS. For more information and a comprehensive documentation please visit https://github.com/chuwyler
